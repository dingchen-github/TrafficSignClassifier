# Traffic Sign Recognition
Using deep learning and convolutional neural networks!

This is my third project in the Udacity Nanodegree program [Self-Driving Car Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

The code is in [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/dingchen-github/TrafficSignClassifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) and the implementation explanation is in [writeup.md](https://github.com/dingchen-github/TrafficSignClassifier/blob/master/writeup.md).


The Project
---
In this project, I will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will then try out my model on images of German traffic signs that I find on the web.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
